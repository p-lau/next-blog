# The Tingler App Development

For our IQP and MQP, Jordan and I have researched *The Tingler* and its historic presence. It is the first motion picture to incorporate haptic sensations. We inspect the career of the director, William Castle, a legendary Hollywood huckster famous for his use of gimmicks to attract audiences to his low- budget horror films. Our particular focus is Percepto!, the simple but effective gimmick created for *The Tingler* to deliver physical “shocks” to viewers. The operation, deployment and promotion of Percepto! are explored in detail, based on recently-discovered documents provided to exhibitors by Columbia Pictures, the film’s distributor. We conclude with a proposal for a method of recreating Percepto! for contemporary audiences using Web technologies and smartphones.\

The web app itself is hosted on <https://percepto.netlify.app/>. It uses recent advances in web technology such as the use of Service Workers, Vibration API, Push API, and Google Firebase for SaaS backend development. The web app is a Progressive Web App, which is installable on iOS and Android, however, Push API (at the time of writing) has not made its way to iOS just yet. Feel free to try out the Tingler vibrations with a partner!\

The native applications are still in development, and will be released soon in 2021.
